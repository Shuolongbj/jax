# JAX Examples

Each example is designed to be **self-contained and easily forkable**, while
reproducing relevant results in different areas of machine learning.

As a standard pattern for all examples including the simplest ones
(like MNIST). This makes every example a bit more verbose, but once you know
one example, you know the structure of all of them. Having unit tests and
integration tests is also very useful when you fork these examples.

You can run the script as:

python -m examples.mnist_classifier

from the **JAX source tree**.
